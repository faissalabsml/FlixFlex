# FlixFlex

Hi! This is my work in the movie app FlixFlex

[FlixFlex](https://flixflex-77b18.web.app/)

## UI Design choices

I did a quick sketch on Figma just to have an idea on how to structure the elements and how to layout the different pages, it's not a completely full design project, but it was a quick one that I come up with.

[Figma link](https://www.figma.com/file/QPxbIVQAmfNTyVD2Y6b0vq/FlixFlex?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=0AVxRH2u0nWAp7RW-1)

## Languages, libraries and tools used

The project was fully built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React, I was going to use Tailwind but I decided to stick with CSS to personalise freely.
For authentication, I used Firebase (it was the first time ever working with it)
NPM, Vite, GIT, GitHub and VS Code for development.
For deployment, I went with Netlify.

## What I learned

- Firebase authentication.
- Using the TMDB API.
- How to build a horizontal scrolling element.

## What I practised

- Axios and how to fetch.
- React useReducer, useState and useEffect.
- React router, useLocation and useNavigate.
- CSS Flexbox and variables.

## My process

After a quick sketching in Figma, I started working on the home page, the top5 section and the popular section, after that I jumped to the title details page, then searching. Using Firebase was new to me, so I decided to create a project, link it to my project and fix any bugs that might come up.

The finishing touches were displaying more movies and TV shows lists (popular, top-rated, airing today...), work on the responsiveness of the app, fix any bugs and add more little details to make the app more well-designed and easy to use.

**Thank you for checking out the project and hope to hear from you soon**
